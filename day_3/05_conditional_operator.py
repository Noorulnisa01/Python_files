# Conditional operator

# There are some logical operators:
# 1. equal to               ==
# 2. Not equal to           !=
# 3. less than              <
# 4. Greater than           >
# 5. less than equal to     <=
# 6. greater than equal to  >=

# Example

print(4==4) # it's means that 4 is equal to 4.

# it will give answer in " true or false" / "yes or no" / "0 and 1"
print(4!=4)

# where logical functions are apply ?
# any program where we want to compare two value to get result

# input function and logical operator
